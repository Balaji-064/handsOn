  <h3>BIRTH:-</h3>
  <p> Born on 15th October 1931 at Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu, <strong>Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</strong>,
    specialized in Aeronautical Engineering from Madras Institute of Technology. Dr. Kalam made significant contribution
    as Project Director to develop India's first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully
    injected the Rohini satellite in the near earth orbit in July 1980 and made India an exclusive member of Space Club.
    He was responsible for the evolution of ISRO's launch vehicle programme, particularly the PSLV configuration. After
    working for two decades in ISRO and mastering launch vehicle technologies, Dr. Kalam took up the responsibility of
    developing Indigenous Guided Missiles at Defence Research and Development Organisation as the Chief Executive of
    Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP). He was responsible for the development and
    operationalisation of AGNI and PRITHVI Missiles and for building indigenous capability in critical technologies
    through networking of multiple institutions. He was the Scientific Adviser to Defence Minister and Secretary,
    Department of Defence Research & Development from July 1992 to December 1999. During this period he led to the
    weaponisation of strategic missile systems and the Pokhran-II nuclear tests in collaboration with Department of
    Atomic Energy, which made India a nuclear weapon State. He also gave thrust to self-reliance in defence systems by
    progressing multiple development tasks and mission projects such as Light Combat Aircraft.</p>
  <h3>Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam's Biography - Kalam as a Scientist</h3>
  <p>Kalam joined as a scientist in the aeronautical development establishment of DRDO in 1960, after graduation. His
    career started with him designing a small hovercraft. However, he was not convinced by his choice of a job at the
    DRDO. Kalam was transferred to ISRO in 1969, where he was the project director of India's first satellite vehicle
    launch. The satellite vehicle deployed the Rohini satellite successfully in near-Earth orbit in July 1980. Kalam
    received the Government's LV and Slv projects between the 1970s-90s</p>
  <h3>Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam's Biography -Kalam as the 11th President of India </h3>
  <p>The “office of profit”, according to the English Act of Settlement in 1701 explains that no single individual who
    has a professional set up under the royal family, who has some kind of provision with or who is taking a pension
    from the prince has the right to work for the of the “House of Commons”.</p>

    <p>From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as principal
      scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. His prominent role in the
      country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a national hero,
      although the tests caused great concern in the international community. In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide
      plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for transforming India from a less-developed
      to a developed society in 20 years. The plan called for, among other measures, increasing agricultural
      productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to health care and
      education.</p>

    <p>Daily namaz and fasting during Ramadan were integral to the life of Kalam, a practising Sunni
